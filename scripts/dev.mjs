/**
 * Local dev server via esbuild context + serve. Watches src/, rebuilds, and
 * serves `.dev/`. (In the editor, the in-browser esbuild-wasm preview is used
 * instead; this is for standalone local development of the template.)
 *
 * `.dev/` IS NOT `dist/`. `pnpm build` wipes and rewrites `dist/`, and this
 * server used to serve that same folder — so a build run while dev was up made
 * the dev page silently load the production bundle (dev-only input and overlays
 * gone, which reads as a camera bug), and `vincentt publish` could upload a dev
 * bundle a stray `pnpm dev` had left in `dist/`. A separate, gitignored output
 * folder removes both: the dev page only ever serves dev output, `dist/` only
 * ever holds a production build, and the tree-shake suite that reads `dist/`
 * never meets a dev build (vincentt-xr/v2-template#114).
 *
 * Unlike the production build, dev output is unhashed so `.dev/index.html` can
 * reference stable filenames (`main.js`, `main.css`). Without this, the HTML
 * on disk only matches the bundle from the last build; subsequent dev rebuilds
 * emit fresh hashed files and the HTML keeps pointing at stale ones — the
 * browser loads pre-edit code with no obvious signal.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS. esbuild's server binds one address family: its default is IPv4
 * (`0.0.0.0`), and asking for `::` makes it refuse IPv4 requests outright. A
 * browser that resolves `localhost` to `::1` — the embedded preview browser
 * does — then gets connection refused at the address AGENTS.md names. So
 * esbuild listens privately on an ephemeral `127.0.0.1` port, and this script
 * fronts it with two loopback listeners, `127.0.0.1:5173` and `[::1]:5173`,
 * forwarding every request (the live-reload event stream included). `localhost`
 * works whichever family the client picks (vincentt-xr/v2-template#115).
 *
 * Loopback only by default. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` (or a LAN address) to listen on
 * one explicit address instead, e.g. to open the dev page from a phone on the
 * same network. `pnpm preview` does not need that: the CLI tunnels to this
 * machine's loopback.
